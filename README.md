# Deep Viz
A web app to visualize results from [Deep Learning][deep learning].

![example](static/example_dv.png?raw=true "Example")

To run this app just run `python app.py`.

####  Requires:
1. [Deep Learning][deep learning] - The project centered on using deep neural networks in high energy physics.
2. [Flask][flask] - The python-based web server framework used in this project.

Hopefully the dashboard is easy to understand, but please direct any questions/suggestions to the issues area on github.

Enjoy!
